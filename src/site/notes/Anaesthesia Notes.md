This collection of notes has been created as a revision guide for the FRCA and FANZCA
They have been created between multiple sits of exams - I was unsuccessful in two fellowship exam attempts before switching to computer-based notes.

You can therefore expect gaps in the notes, which correspond to areas I considered either too basic to re-write, or felt confident in

Good luck with all you do
